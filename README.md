# around-the-world

Explanations of the technologies used
I used code-pen io to implement the animation of the plane. I used google fonts for the font. Furthermore, I used javascript, jquery, html, and css to create my game.
Approach taken
I started off researching the trivia questions. I tackled the functionality of the questions first. I created an array of objects and took it from there. It was difficult figuring out how to access each question and loop through it. I did this by creating a function using jQuery to access each question individually.
